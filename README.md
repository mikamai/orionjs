Orion - Mikamai custom distribution
=====

Orion is an open source framework built on meteor that makes complex as well as simple apps possible with minimal effort. Itâ€™s built, modified, used, and supported by an active community of people around the world.

This is **not an official distribution**   
We packaged a vanilla Orion installation with some custom amde packages.  
Specifically we added:  

- a filesystem module tha do not rely on `orionFiles` collection
- a file attribute that writes the file name, instead of an object  
- an S3 filesystem adapter that adds `AWS_S3_PATH` configuration for S3 path inside the bucket
